Lamar Event System (Lamar EMS) Prototype - A web application for students, staff, and professors to create, find, and RSVP for events on campus.

HOW TO RUN: (Using UBUNTU)

Before all, unzip lamarems3, open UBUNTU (or any linux powershell), and open the folder.

The process should look along the lines of:
1. cd /mnt/c/Users/chi/Downloads
2. cd lamarems3

From there, you will:

1. Install dependancies (type/paste): npm install
2. Run the server (type/paste): node server.js
Your output should read: Lamar EMS server running on http://localhost:3000
3. Using your browser, open: http://localhost:3000
4. You should now have the website running. Log in, and serach through, RSVP, create, or approve/deny events depending on your role.
